# Assignment1 - DECIDE

## Anti-ballistic missile system

DECIDE() is a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system that determines whether an interceptor should be
launched based upon available input radar tracking information. In such a case where an interceptor should be launched, a launch-unlock signal will be issued.

## Ways Of Working

**Where?** We believe that we are currently in the: In Use phase. **Why?** To start off with, we are currently using tools and practices to do real work. We have established a set of principles which we follow and are agreed to. As for the foundation, a set of tools to be used has been established. We use the following: Discord for communicating meetings and informal exchanges of information, GitHub as a platform to manage the code, Java as our selected language (and Junit for testing). This includes non-negotiable practices such as using issues and commits properly. These selected tools and practices form a way-of-working that we adhere to. **How to progress?** First of all we have to regularly inspect the tools we selected, perhaps finding better ways to use them or even using other tools. Furthermore we need to implement procedures that allow for handling of feedback in regards to the way we are working.
